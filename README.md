## Security

### Debug Interface Security

Production hardware **must** disable all debug interfaces to prevent unauthorized access:

- **JTAG/SWD**: Disable JTAG via silicon fuse bits (e.g., SAM-BA efuses, STM32 RDP Level 2) before shipping. The ePower board already documents this — eRadar360 should follow the same practice for J6.
- **Depopulate debug headers**: Remove JTAG headers (J2, J6) from production builds. Use DNP (Do Not Populate) designators on BOM for production variants.
- **Series resistors**: Add 0-ohm DNP series resistors on TCK/TMS/TDI lines so debug traces can be physically disconnected in production.
- **UART debug console**: Disable or restrict UART2 debug output in production firmware. Do not expose boot ROM messages on shipping devices. Consider removing TP7/TP8 test points in production.

### Hardware Security Module (HSM) Considerations

- Use on-chip secure enclaves or external HSMs for key storage (firmware signing keys, device identity certificates).
- Enable secure boot chain: bootloader must verify firmware signatures before execution.
- Store cryptographic keys in hardware-protected key slots — never in firmware flash.
- Implement hardware-backed random number generation (TRNG) for cryptographic operations.

### Physical Tamper Protection

- Apply conformal coating over sensitive signal traces (JTAG, UART, SPI) on production boards.
- Consider tamper-detect mesh or enclosure switches that trigger key zeroization on physical intrusion.
- Use BGA packages where possible to reduce probe-ability of sensitive signal lines.
- Restrict access to reset lines (nRESET, nRST) — exposed reset pins allow glitching attacks.
- Remove or obfuscate silkscreen labels for debug connectors and test points in production.

### Repository Access

- This repository contains sensitive hardware design details (debug pinouts, component placements, test point locations). Restrict access to authorized personnel only.
- Do not share BOM part numbers, pick-and-place coordinates, or debug header pinouts publicly.
